# Shopping Customer Segmentation Project

## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of KMeans clustering on customer data using Python. The clustering is performed based on features like `Annual Income`, `Spending Score`, and `Age`, with support for feature scaling and analysis.

## Features
- Implements KMeans clustering on customer data.
- Supports feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.
- Provides insights into clusters using inertia scores and cross-tabulation.
- Includes visualizations for the Elbow Method and cluster distributions.
- 
## Dataset
This project uses the `Mall_Customers.csv` dataset, which contains customer data with the following features:
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
- `Gender`: The gender of the customer (Male/Female).
- `Age`: Age of the customer.
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: A score assigned based on the customer's spending habits.

You can find the dataset [here](Mall_Customers.csv).
