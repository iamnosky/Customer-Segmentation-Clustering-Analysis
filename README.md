# Shopping Customer Segmentation Project

## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of KMeans clustering on customer data using Python. The clustering is performed based on features like `Annual Income`, `Spending Score`, and `Age`, with support for feature scaling and analysis.

## Features
- Implements KMeans clustering on customer data.
- Supports feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.
- Provides insights into clusters using inertia scores and cross-tabulation.
- Includes visualizations for the Elbow Method and cluster distributions.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamnosky/Customer-Segmentation-Clustering-Analysis.git
